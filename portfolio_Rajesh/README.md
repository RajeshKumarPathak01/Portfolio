Replace Images: Update the image paths in src/assets/ and references in App.js with your own profile photo and project images.

LLM Integration (Optional): If you're using the Gemini API, ensure your API key is configured securely (preferably via environment variables if deploying to production, as hardcoding is shown for demonstration).
